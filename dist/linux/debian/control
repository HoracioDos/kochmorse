Description: The Intrinsic Noise Analyzer
 iNA is a computational tool for quantitative analysis of fluctuations in biochemical reaction
 networks. Such fluctuations, also known as intrinsic noise, arise due to the stochastic nature of
 chemical reactions and cannot be ignored when some molecules are present in very low copy numbers
 only, as is the case in living cells. The SBML-based software computes statistical measures such
 as means and standard deviations of concentrations within a given accuracy. This is carried out
 automatically using the system size expansion whose leading order term is the popular Linear Noise
 Approximation. The results of the analysis can be tested against the computationally much more
 expensive stochastic simulation algorithm.
